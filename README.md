"SEvent" which aims to build a college event web app that tries to help college students attend the events organized at their college. Students need a system that provides them the easiest way to attend any events(like workshops, seminars, competitions, etc. ); since few direct competitors in the market solve the student problem but require irrelevant personal details. Moreover, the students have to rely on different social media products to receive the event notifications that make them disoriented.
"SEvent" is a minimalistic and aesthetic visual pleasing product with a great user experience that will solve this problem by taking less information from the students to join any event.
